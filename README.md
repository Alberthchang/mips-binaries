# mips-binaries

This repo contains binaries that I've cross-compiled for the mips architeture. I thought I would make them public because it's quite difficult to find this kind of stuff, and cross-compiling is a super pain in the ***. Caution: some of these binaries may not run on your system, as this is a finicky process. The binaries that I have tested that do work well include:

* autossh
* bash (verison 4.3)
* busybox-mips
* dbd (see <a href="https://github.com/gitdurandal/dbd">gitdurandal/dbd</a>
* dropbear
* socat
* synflood (Just a C script for stress testing)
* tor (the daemon)


Binaries that work, but not well:

* openvpn

Binaries that I am pretty sure don't work or can't remember what they are:
* python (would not run)
* client (I think it's a tftp client)
* server (^)
