# Open Source Software

All of the binaries here were compiled from open source, GPL code. You can find the GPL license all over the net, but it basically
boils down to this:

* You can use, edit, redistribute, do whatever as long as you...

-- Give credit to the authors
-- Keep the source code open, and make the source code publicly available
